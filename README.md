# Single-neural-network
Deploying a single neuron learning process
First off, it's all about modelling a single neuron from scratch, using Numpy as the only library imported for the sake of helping array manipulation.
Then, we deploy and deconstruct what's happening behind the scenes when the neuron uses the train set to recogn a pattern that relates inputs & outputs.
